# FloatingViewService
<p>This is a simple example of how to make a view that sits on top of all other apps and it is independant of any activity.</br>
In order to create your own overlay, just create a service that extends the AbstractOverlayService and override the required methods. It's *that* easy! :P</p>

<b>EXTRAS</b>
<p>In the sample project, there is an activity that will make the overlay appear when the app is in the background, or hide it when the app is in the foreground.
</br></br>
This project works only as a concept and idea on what you can do with overlays and how to get started. If you do use some of the code used here, give credit if you feel like it, or mention the repo somewhere in your project.</p>
